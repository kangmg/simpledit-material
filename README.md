# $${\Large \text{simpl}}{\Large \color{blue}\text{edit}\color{white}\text{-material}}$$

This project is a simple JavaScript-based molecular editor. It was created because only a few JS-based molecular editors are currently available. The current version is a pre-alpha prototype with a very minimal user interface.

Avogadro2 and the [rowan](https://labs.rowansci.com/editor) are excellent alternatives. However, this project was initiated as a foundation for future work and experimentation.
